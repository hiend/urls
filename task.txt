We want you to build a command line application that parse a list of URLs from an input file.
The tool must contact these URLs and output the headers, response code and latency into an output file.
An example input file called `urls` is supplied with this README
## Functional Requirements
- The path to the input file must be configurable. Allowing the user to specify what file to use at runtime.
- The path to the output file must be configurable. Allowing the user to specifiy where to output the results.
- The application must support two output formats: JSON and plain text. The user must be able to choose the output format at runtime.
- All the above configurable options must have sensible default values
